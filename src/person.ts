/**
 * # Part 1) Person
 * We recommend you complete this part first!
 *
 * Note that you will need to define and export the class and all the functions in this file, before you can
 * run the unit tests. Write "stubs" for the functions before you try to implement them (just the header and a
 * basic return statement, returning a suitable "dummy" value, such as 0 or ""). This will allow you to run the
 * tests and see which functions are being called, and what they are returning.
 *
 * 1.1 Create a class named `Person` that has three fields: `firstName` (string), `lastName` (string), and `age` (number).
 *      Make the `age` field public, but the name fields should be private.
 * 1.2. Create a Person constructor that takes in three parameters (firstName, lastName, age) and assigns them to the appropriate fields.
 * 1.3. Create a Person method named `getDogYears` that returns the age of the person in dog years (age * 7).
 * 1.4. Create a Person method named `getFullName` that returns the full name of the person (firstName + lastName)
 *      with a space in between.
 * 1.5. Create a Person method named `withTitle` that consumes a string parameter (title) and returns the
 *      last name of the person with the title before it. For example, if the person's last name is "Bart" and
 *      the title is "Dr.", then the result is "Dr. Bart".
 * 1.6. Create a Person method named `clone` that returns a new Person object with the same first name, last name, and age.
